# Power-Automate

### 1. **Automated Report Subscription with Dynamic Recipients**  
   - **Scenario**: Instead of manually sharing reports, automatically email Power BI reports to different stakeholders based on conditions (e.g., region, department).  
   - **How?**  
     - Use **Power Automate + Power BI API** to trigger emails when a report is refreshed.  
     - Fetch recipient list from **SharePoint/Excel** and filter dynamically.  
     - Attach PDF/PNG exports of the report.  

### 2. **Alert-Based Report Trigger for Anomalies**  
   - **Scenario**: Get notified when a KPI in Power BI crosses a threshold (e.g., sales drop by 20%).  
   - **How?**  
     - Use **Power BIâ€™s "Alert" feature** to detect anomalies.  
     - Trigger a **Power Automate flow** to:  
       - Send an email/SMS via **Twilio**.  
       - Log the issue in a **SharePoint List** or **Teams channel**.  

### 3. **Auto-Refresh Power BI Dataset on File Upload**  
   - **Scenario**: When a new CSV/Excel file is uploaded to **OneDrive/SharePoint**, automatically refresh the Power BI dataset.  
   - **How?**  
     - Set up a **"When a file is created"** trigger in Power Automate.  
     - Use the **Power BI API** to refresh the dataset.  
     - Optional: Send a confirmation email.  

### 4. **Dynamic Report Comments & Feedback Loop**  
   - **Scenario**: Let users submit feedback on Power BI reports via **Microsoft Forms** and log responses in a dashboard.  
   - **How?**  
     - Create a **Microsoft Form** for feedback.  
     - Use Power Automate to:  
       - Capture responses.  
       - Append them to a **Power BI dataset (Excel/SharePoint)**.  
       - Auto-reply with a thank-you email.  

### 5. **Automated Approval Workflow for Report Changes**  
   - **Scenario**: Require manager approval before publishing changes to a Power BI report.  
   - **How?**  
     - Trigger a flow when a **Power BI report is modified** (via API or scheduled check).  
     - Send an **approval request via Teams/Email**.  
     - If approved, publish changes; if rejected, notify the author.  

### **Bonus Idea**:  
- **Auto-Archive Old Reports**: Use Power Automate to move unused Power BI reports to an archive folder after X days of inactivity.  

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these? ðŸš€
